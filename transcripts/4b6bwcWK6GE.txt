- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast
where we discuss science
and science-based tools for everyday life.
Welcome, I'm Andrew Huberman,
and I'm a professor of
neurobiology and ophthalmology
at Stanford School of Medicine.
That's what I do for my day job,
but over the last few years
I've become very active
in teaching neuroscience
and neuroscience-related
themes on social media.
And I've also been fortunate
enough to be hosted as a guest
on various people's podcasts
to discuss neuroscience and
neuroscience-related tools.
So through those discussions
and your feedback,
I've decided to launch a podcast
where we dive really deep
into scientific topics
and the tools related to those topics.
Now, the format of this podcast
is going to be a little bit different
than many podcasts out there.
Most podcasts jump from
topic to topic each episode
or change guests each episode.
On the Huberman Lab Podcast,
we're going to dive deep
into individual topics for
an entire month at a time.
So for instance, we might
take an entire month
and go really deep into the
topic of motivation and focus
and talk all about the science
underlying motivation and focus,
what's known, what's not known,
and then discuss the various tools
as well as some of the barriers
to motivation and focus
that exist out there
as a way for you to really understand
how these processes work within you
and within the people that you know,
and in some ways to possibly get better
at things like motivation and focus.
Sometimes, it's going to
be just me talking to you,
other times, it's going to be a guest
here in the studio with me,
and still other times we
might hold guests remotely
and have discussions with them over Zoom
or some other distanced format.
There's another thing that's
unusual about this podcast,
which is that you, if you choose,
can be a very active participant
by placing your suggestions
about which topics to cover
and which information you
would like to learn more about
in the comment section.
We are going to pay careful
attention to those comments
and the number of likes
that those comments receive.
So the comment section is a place
for you to give us constructive criticism,
give us praise if you like,
but most importantly
it's going to be a place
for you to make suggestions
about what you would
like to hear more about,
and we will respond to that.
So if you have suggestions for topics now,
please put them in the
comment section below.
If you're coming to
this a little bit later,
please upvote or vote for the things
that you want to hear more about.
And obviously don't vote for the ones
that you would like to hear less about.
Those are the main
features of this podcast.
Every month a different topic in depth
as well as the tools that
relate to that topic.
I just briefly wanna touch
on what I mean by tools.
Tools these days for
enhancing one's nervous system
or any aspect of their
biology and psychology
come in different forms.
Some come in the form of behavioral tools,
so things that you would want to do
to get a particular result of, say,
focus or enhancing sleep
or learning and plasticity.
Other tools are about
not doing certain things
to get better sleep or focus
or plasticity for instance.
Still other tools relate to things
like nutrition or supplementation
or prescription drugs
or brain-machine interface,
devices that you use
to monitor your nervous
system and biology,
or to change your nervous
system and biology.
We're gonna cover all of that
as well as their various
advantages and disadvantages.
So again, please use the comment section
as a place to make suggestions,
and we will pay attention to those,
and you really have an opportunity
to actively shape the
direction of the podcast.
There's one other thing that's
unusual about this podcast,
which is that I have a very large
90-pound bulldog mastiff named Costello,
and he insists on snoring
(Costello snoring)
in the background while I'm recording.
It seems to be his favorite thing.
So from time to time,
you may hear his snoring
or other grunts and various
bulldog-like things.
He is an active participant
in the Huberman Lab,
he's a steady member of the
podcast, so you can look forward
to more Costello
appearances in the future.
Very last, but certainly not least,
I very much appreciate
your interest in science
and science-related topics.
Thanks so much for your
time and attention,
and I look forward to seeing
you here again very soon.
